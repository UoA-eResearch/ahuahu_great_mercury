# special atention needed
#Station - Source
#Photo - Media

Should these be grouped somehow?
#rock1
#rock2
#rock3

I have implemented these by using the "Analysed" type as a CA keyword on the Bone/StoneArtefact models
#(BoneAnalysed)
#(StoneArtefactAnalysed)

# what to do with these
#center
#Section
#TransectBoundary
#BaseHeight
#Elevation
